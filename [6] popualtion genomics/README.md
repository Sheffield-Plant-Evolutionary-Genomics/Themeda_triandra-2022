** [1] Calculating genotype likelihoods**

Genotype likelihoods were estimated across the entire TtPh16-4 nuclear genome using ANGSD v.0.929-13-gb5c4df3 (Korneliussen et al., 2014) and the bowtie2 alignments generated in step **[3.2] Mapping data to the reference genome** above with organelle sequences excluded.
