**[1] Pairwise dn/ds**

Pairwise estimation of the ratio (Ï‰) of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions between sequences was calculated using the Yang and Nielson (2000) using 2 representative sequences.

'yn00 yn00.ctl`

required control file = `yn00.ctl`

required alignment file = `yn00.phy`
