## Inferring the phylogenetic history of Themeda using single copy nuclear genes

A reference-based approach was used to generate consensus sequences for single-copy nuclear genes to infer phylogenetic relationships. Our analysis focused on the 3,303 Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs in the poales_odb10 database identified in the TtPh16-4 genome (see step **[1.7] Assessing assembly quality** for details).
