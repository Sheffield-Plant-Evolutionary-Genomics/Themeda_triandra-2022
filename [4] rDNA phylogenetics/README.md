## Inferring the phylogenetic history of Themeda using the rDNA array

The methods are the same as those used for the chloroplast analysis, please see **[2] Plastid phylogenetics** for detailed methods. 

The only ammendments were:

[1] The NOVOPlasty control file `config.txt` which included a different seed alingment `ITS_BAIT.fasta`

[2] The alignments were trimmed to the 5.80 kb rDNA coding region consisting of 18S, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, 26S using Geneious prior to ML inference
