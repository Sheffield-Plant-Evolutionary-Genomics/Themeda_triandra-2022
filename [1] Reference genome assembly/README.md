## Generating a reference Themeda triandra genome

As part of this project we generated a *Themeda triandra* reference genome assemble for the TtPh16-4 accession colelcted from the Carranglan region of the Philippines (15°56'35.8“ N  121°00'26.2“ E). A PacBio library was prepared by The University of Sheffield Molecular Ecology Laboratory, and sequenced on two PacBio Sequel SMRT cells generating approximetly 20.93 Gb of PacBio subread data (N50 = 5.61 kb).

The intial assmbel was generated using Canu v.2.0 (Koren et al., 2017)
